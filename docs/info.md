## How it works

A mini TPU that computes `C = A x W` with **INT8 activations** and **1:2
structurally sparse E2M1 weights** — the 4-bit floating-point element type
shared by NVFP4 (NVIDIA Blackwell) and MXFP4. It combines the two numerics
levers from Roune's AI-chip design argument in one datapath: structured
sparsity along the contraction axis *and* a 4-bit float element — with
higher-precision INT8 activations, the side that is hardest to quantize.

The math runs on **one time-multiplexed processing element**, not a
spatial array: a SPI-driven design is completely SPI-bound (the 36 operand
instructions require at least 3456 `clk` cycles at SCLK <= clk/6), so a RUN's compute latency is
practically free no matter how many outputs share one PE. The original
3x3 systolic array spent 58% of its flip-flops and most of its
combinational logic on 9-way spatial parallelism that bought nothing;
serializing to one PE — reused across all 9 outputs, ~45 cycles per RUN,
still about 1.3% of the SPI load time — cut chip area ~47% and dropped the
design from a 2x2 to a **1x2 tile**.

There is **no hardware multiplier anywhere**: every E2M1 magnitude
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 in the x2 integer domain) is `(1 or 3) << shift`,
so a product is one conditional add (the 3x), one shift, and one
conditional negate:

```
prod = ± (act [+ act << 1]) << shift
```

### The sparse weight format

Each 5-bit weight code `{select, e2m1[3:0]}` covers **two** consecutive
contraction steps (k = 2j and k = 2j+1): the E2M1 value sits at
`k = 2j + select`, the other position is zero — 1:2 structured sparsity,
the 1:2 analog of NVIDIA's 2:4. The select bit muxes which INT8 activation
of a pair enters the shift-add, so an 8-bit mux does the work of a second
"multiplier" and every cycle advances two contraction steps: an 8-deep dot
product in the time a dense array does 4, with weights stored at 2.5 bits
per dense position. **Two sparse RUNs cover exactly one NVFP4 16-element
block** (four cover an MXFP4 32-block), so host-side block scaling aligns
with no padding.

Results are exact 14-bit signed integers (max |C| = 6144). Block scaling
happens on the host during dequantization: scale each block's partial sum
before adding it to other blocks, `C = sum_b((D_b / 2) * partial_b)`.
This makes the chip element-level format-agnostic: apply E4M3 scales per 16-element block
(+ FP32 tensor scale) for **NVFP4** semantics, or E8M0 power-of-two scales
per 32-element block for **MXFP4**. The exact accumulators let the host
apply per-block scales (including four-over-six adaptive scaling and
per-token activation scales) to bit-exact partial sums.

### Second mode: dense E2M1 x INT8

The RUN instruction's `d` flag switches to **dense** operation: each code's
E2M1 nibble is a weight for ONE contraction step (K = 4, half throughput,
select bit ignored, only even activation elements participate) — the same
trade NVIDIA makes running dense on 2:4-sparse tensor cores. This is plain
dense FP4-weight x INT8-activation matmul. E2M1 checkpoint weights can be
streamed after the host quantizes activations to INT8 and handles all block
and tensor scales; it is not native FP4-activation execution.

SPI protocol follows the proven reference mini-TPU
([MILOUDIAS/IEEE_ttsky_mini_tpu_spi](https://github.com/MILOUDIAS/IEEE_ttsky_mini_tpu_spi)),
which this chip's original 3x3 array also ported its systolic control
from; a `(row, col, step)` sequencer replaced the skewed wavefront when
the array serialized to one PE (see REPORT.md). Both operand streams
still change every RUN step (real dot products, not a shortcut). Activation
functions are host-side: they are only correct after cross-tile
partial-sum accumulation and bias, which happen on the host anyway.

### Instruction set (16 bits, sent LSB-first over SPI)

| Instruction | Format (binary)        | Description |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `LOAD A`    | `10 0 rr eee aaaaaaaa` | INT8 activation byte `a` into row `r` (0-2), element `e` (0-7) |
| `LOAD B`    | `10 1 cc 0jj 000swwww` | Weight code {select `s`, E2M1 `w`} into column `c` (0-2), pair slot `j` (0-3) |
| `RUN`       | `01 d 0000000000000`   | Clear accumulators, run all 9 outputs on one PE (~45 cycles); `d`=0 sparse (K=8), `d`=1 dense E2M1 (K=4) |
| `STORE`     | `11 b rr cc 000000000` | Drive byte `b` (0 = acc[7:0], 1 = acc[13:8]) of C[r][c] on `uo_out` |

The system clock is 10 MHz and SCLK must be at most clk/6 (about 1.67 MHz).
MOSI, CS, and SCLK pass through synchronizers and the receiver runs entirely
in the system-clock domain; raw SCLK is not an internal clock. Keep CS high
for at least four system-clock cycles between frames. The `ready` pin
(uio[1]) stays high when a RUN completes and clears when the next RUN is
accepted, so a polling host cannot miss it. Instructions received while RUN
is busy are ignored. Alternatively, wait ~45+ clock cycles. The SPI is
receive-only: all results are read via STORE on `uo_out`, from a small
result memory that holds all 9 outputs until the next RUN overwrites them
(the same "any output, any time" contract the old per-PE accumulators
offered).

### E2M1 weight encoding (element type of NVFP4 and MXFP4)

## How to test

Run the cocotb testbench:

```
cd test
make -B
make pe-test
make control-test
cd ..
python -m pytest -p no:rerunfailures test/test_host.py
```

The suite drives the SPI interface exactly like an external host and checks
the full `C = A x W` result against an **independent golden model** (E2M1
and sparse-code decode from first principles, then a plain matrix multiply).
It includes select-bit routing, both modes with per-RUN mode latching,
negative-zero handling, a non-degeneracy test (equal-sum activation
matrices must produce different results), exact accumulator limits,
accumulator-clear checks, every partial SPI-frame length, reset mid-frame,
maximum-rate SPI, sticky ready, and randomized full-coverage trials. An
exhaustive PE test covers all 16,384 input/mode combinations. It also checks
that partial sums from blocks
with different scales are dequantized before being combined.

The production TTSKY26c flow also passes GDS generation, Tiny Tapeout
precheck, and gate-level simulation on the required **1x2 tile**. At the
10 MHz constraint, final routed multi-corner STA reports zero setup and hold
violations (worst setup slack +70.8412 ns, worst hold slack +0.0576 ns).
Routed DRC, Magic DRC, LVS, and antenna violation counts are zero; final
standard-cell utilization is 80.54%.

One physical-quality gap remains despite the passing production checks:
post-route STA reports maximum-transition warnings at slow process corners
(688 in the worst corner) and one marginal maximum-capacitance warning.
They do not change functional behavior or the 10 MHz setup/hold result, but
should be reduced or explicitly reviewed before tapeout.

## External hardware

None required. Any SPI-capable host (e.g. the demo board's RP2040) drives
MOSI/CS/SCLK and reads result bytes on `uo_out`. Operand memories do not reset
to save area, so the host must load every operand used before the first RUN.
